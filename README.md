# Samba Active Directory Domain Controller for Docker
This is a development fork to raise the version of samba to 4.21 and run at a function level of 2016. Will be working on this for a bit.

From original fork:
A well documented, tried and tested Samba Active Directory Domain Controller that works with the standard Windows management tools; built from scratch using internal DNS and kerberos and not based on existing containers.
